<h1 id="band-renaming">Band Renaming</h1>
<p>Some history&#8230;</p>

<p>This project was originally called Old Bone Orchard, after a line in the Neil Gaiman book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011UJM48/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">&#8220;Graveyard&#8221;</a>, where the main character walks through a cemetary and calls it &#8220;the old bone orchard&#8221;. I thought then, that THAT was a PERFECT name for an Americana based music project.</p>

<p>And&#8230;.. I was right. I was SO right, in fact, that a quick Google search revealed an Americana music project called <a href="http://www.boneorchardmusic.com/">Bone Orchard</a>, with several releases out already.</p>

<p>Curses&#8230;.foiled again. One day I will learn to check everything out prior to buying the domain name.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s with the weaving? I get the bones part of the title&#8230;</p>

<p>Going forward&#8230;</p>

<p>I was in my hometown this past weekend for <a href="http://www.pensacon.com">Pensacon</a> and was driving past Texar Dr.</p>

<p>Now, one of the ways to tell a local from a vistor is how they pronounce &#8220;Bayou Texar&#8221;. I thought, &#8220;That would be a GREAT band name!&#8221;</p>

<p>This time I checked it out and the only other thing that doesn&#8217;t come up in searching for Texar is a Credit Union. Everything else is Pensacola based.</p>

<p>Texar, by the way, is a Latin word meaning &#8220;to weave&#8221;. I like to think that the musical genre of Americana weaves in and out of our cultural fabric, so I can live with it. The Spaniards named the street when they were in control of Pensacola, Florida, back in 1696.</p>

<p>I have several rough ideas recorded that I need to ingest into my studio system and begin fleshing out. New music IS coming&#8230; I promise.</p>
